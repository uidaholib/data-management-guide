## Contributing 

Outside contributors are welcome and encouraged to help make these docs better!
If you discover an error, or a page in need of an update or clarification, please [open an new Issue](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/cb-docs/issues) describing the problem, including link to the page.
If you would like to edit directly, please [Fork this repository and open a Pull Request with your changes](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/). 
This can be facilitated by following the "Edit this page on GitHub" link at the bottom of any content page.

Guide content follows these conventions:

- All documentation files are written in Markdown. For clearer version control, editing, and accessibility please:
    - write one sentence per line.
    - always provide a blank line between elements (i.e. headers, paragraphs, lists, code blocks).
    - headers should follow logical order on page without skipping levels.
    - page should always start with an H1 (`# `).
    - code and variables should be given `code` class using backticks, filenames should be given in "quotes".
- Markdown files are located in the "docs" folder and are further organized into folders for each section.
- Each section should have an "index.md" presenting an introduction to the section. 
    - The index should have front matter variables `nav_order` (setting over all order in side bar nav) and `has_children: true`. 
    - The index does NOT need a TOC of section contents, as that will be added automatically by the template.
- Individual doc topics should be their own Markdown file. 
    - Each should have front matter variables `parent` (matching the title of section index) and `nav_order` (setting order within the section). 
    - Content can be styled using [Just the Docs classes and utilities](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/) and CB specific features documented below.
- For pages that shouldn't appear in nav, add front matter `nav_exclude: true`.

Example section index front matter:

```
---
title: Software
nav_order: 2
has_children: true
---
```

Example doc file front matter: 

```
---
title: Install Git and GitHub Desktop
parent: Software
nav_order: 1
---
```

## Content Features

Basic styling components can be added to content pages using Kramdown ["Attribute List syntax"](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html#attribute-list-definitions).
See [Just the Docs docs](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/docs/ui-components) for built in theme UI components.
This project adds a bit of custom styles:

**Buttons**

- add the attribute list directly next to a markdown link starting with the `.btn` class
- add color using `.btn-primary`, `.btn-purple`, `.btn-blue`, or `.btn-green` 
- make into outline only using `.btn-outline`
- e.g. `[Example Link](https://example.com){:.btn .btn-purple}`
- To make the link open in a new tab add `target="_blank" rel="noopener"` to the attribute list syntax.
    - e.g. `[Example Link](https://example.com){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}`
    - e.g. `[Example Link](https://example.com){:.btn .btn-purple target="_blank" rel="noopener"}`

**Alerts**

The `.alert` class adds "card" like styling to a paragraph of text or div (a rounded border, drop shadow, and padding).
This can help text stand out on the page, useful for asides or for important warnings and hints.

In a Markdown paragraph: 

- on the line above *or* below the paragraph, add the class `{:.alert}`
- add color using `.alert-primary`, `.alert-purple`, `.alert-blue`, `.alert-green`, `.alert-yellow`, or `.alert-red`
- e.g. `{:.alert .alert-red}`

As a div around Markdown content:

- on a line above the content you want in the alert, add `<div class="alert alert-red" markdown="1">` (modifying the color class as desired)
- on a line below the markdown content you want in the alert, close the div `</div>`

## Use Locally

- clone repository, `git clone https://github.com/uidaholib/data-management-guide.git`
- in the repository folder, `bundle install` (this project uses "github-pages" gem to keep in sync with GH Pages. this necessary **first time** you use the repository only!)
- in repository folder, `bundle exec jekyll s` to serve the site locally

## Customize Template

- create new UI components in "_includes/feature"
- develop custom color scheme by overriding base variables in "_sass/color_schemes/library.scss"
- add new custom SASS to "_sass/custom/custom.scss"

## About the Theme

This repository is built on "Just the Docs" theme (<https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs>) (MIT license).
The theme was forked in 2021-04 and all files are included in this repository (rather than as a gem theme). 
Some aspects of the theme are customized, some additional component styles are added, and it does not track JTD's updates (it isn't compatible with current JTD versions!).
