# Citing Data

Why cite data? 
Keep in mind that citing data helps increase its visibility and acceptance, incorporates it into the scholarly record, gives credit to the creators of the data, provides authentication to your research, and encourages others to do the same.

Data citation formats are still a work in progress. 
Some data centers and style manuals provide guidelines and examples. 
If you are following a particular style manual, try to form the citation according to the general rules of that style. 
It is usually better to provide more information rather than less.

## Parts of a General Citation:

1.  Responsible party
2.  Title of dataset
3.  Edition or version of dataset, if applicable
4.  Name and location of data center, repository, or publisher
5.  Date data was published
6.  Analysis software, if required
7.  Date accessed
8.  URL, DOI, or other persistent link
9.  Parameters selected, if applicable
