# Data Management Guidelines by Funding Agency

Many funding agencies require that research data produced as part of a funded project be made publicly available and formal data management plans are now required. 
The [SPARC/Johns Hopkins Data Sharing Policy](http://datasharing.sparcopen.org/) project has an up-to-date list of requirements.

Researchers can comply with these data sharing requirements by depositing their data into one of the many available [data repositories](#depositing).
