# DMPs & Guidelines

Data Management Plans (DMPs) are documents that outline the handling, storage,
 and sharing policies governing the use of data on a project.  They are used to
 verify that researchers have thought through the management of their data and
 are prepared to be compliant with agency/organization policies on data sharing
  and/or privacy, security, and associated issues.

Many funding agencies require that research data produced as part of a funded
 project be made publicly available and formal data management plans are now
  required. The [SPARC/Johns Hopkins Data Sharing Policy](http://datasharing.sparcopen.org/) project has an up-to-date list of requirements.

Researchers can comply with these data sharing requirements by depositing their data into one of the many available [data repositories]({{ '/guide/deposit/' | relative_url }}).
