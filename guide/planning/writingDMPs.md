## How to Write a DMP

### 1. Identify your DMP Guidelines

Identify your solicitation or Request for Proposals (RFP) and any guidelines
 regarding data management plans. *Read them* and jot down any specific
  demands.

> > Keep in mind: In NSF, most directorates and some divisions have unique,
 specific or narrower guidelines to follow than the general NSF specifications.

Example:  In response to the [Division of Materials Research: Topical Materials Research Program (DMR:TMRP) Solicitation](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2021/nsf21600/nsf21600.htm), an applicant
 will see the following directions:

{% include feature/figure.html img="nsfDMP_screenshot2.png" alt="example"
 caption="Fig.1 - Screenshot of Data Management Plan Requirements for DMR:TMRP
  2021 Proposals" %}

Within those instructions, applicants are directed to "be responsive" to the
 guidance in the Division of Materials Research document on the following page:

{% include feature/figure.html img="nsfDMP_screenshot1.png" alt="example"
 caption="Fig.2 - Screenshot of Dissemination and Sharing of Research Results -
  NSF Data Management Plan Requirements" %}

Your data management plan should be responsive to any particular demands or
 expectations laid out in these documents. You often are not required to
  follow suggestions precisely, but they expect that your plan will still follow
   the spirit of their guidelines. For example, they may recommend a specific
    repository, but others may be acceptable as well, as long as you accomplish
     the effect of the data shared in a FAIR-compliant manner.

### 2. Outline a Draft Document

Outline a document with the required sections listed in the guidelines. These
 may be spelled out explicitly, or these may be presented as a set of questions
  that you must address. In the latter case, just create sub-headings that
   address each question.

An example would be something like this for the NSF Solicitation above:

{% include feature/figure.html img="nsfDMP_outline.png" alt="Example of an
 NSF-conforming Outline"  caption="Fig.3 - Screenshot of an NSF-conforming DMP
  outline" %}

### 3. Outline Your Project's Outputs

Separately, create a simple outline for yourself of the stages of your
 research project and the material generated at each stage. What is meant by
  material? The outputs – the files, papers, documents, data, notebooks, copies
   of things. The stuff you generate, especially by writing, coding, or
    processing.

### 4. Detail Your Project's Outputs

Create a list of the outputs you outlined above. Next to them, write down
 their file formats, expected size, and any unusual or special circumstances
  associated with them, e.g. privacy or confidentiality steps involved.

### 5. Fill in the Draft with Your Information

Write answers to the questions from item 2 above using the information
 you’ve gathered in items 3 and 4. Everything should read clearly.

### Tips For Success

* Data management plans should be clear, logical, and easy to follow.

* Avoid unnecessary jargon. A reader should be able to follow your project by
 reading your plan. Don’t bother explaining or justifying the science here
  (that's what the other parts of the proposal are for), focus instead on
   explaining the data management. Think ‘what’ and ‘where’ of your data, more
    than ‘why’.

* The DMP should have some unique information not in the rest of the proposal.
 You may not mention publishing the dataset, depositing it into a repository, or
  your choices of metadata schema anywhere else in your proposal. You may not
  mention specifics about data formatting, back-up procedures, or naming
   conventions (if relevant). Here’s the place to do it.

* Don’t overthink it. On the other hand, don’t treat this as an unfunded mandate
 or administrative burden either. Cynicism or hand-wavy dismissal of the task is
  easy for a reader to spot and reflects poorly on your proposal.

* If there are legal or ethical restrictions, write down what you will do to
 meet them and/or how they constrain your ability to share or publish data. If
  you really don't want to follow an expectation in the guidelines, write a
   justified reason for not doing it. Intellectual property and future
    commercialization might be perfectly valid reasons under the right
     circumstances for not publishing data, among others.

* If you don’t know, ask. Some of this might be unfamiliar – what’s a metadata
 schema? What are my repository deposit options? If so, just ask at the U of I
  Library Data Hub. If they aren’t the right people to help, they know the
   people on campus who can.
