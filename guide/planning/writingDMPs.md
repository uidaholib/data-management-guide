## How to Write a DMP

### General Instructions

1. Identify your solicitation or Request for Proposals (RFP) and any guidelines
 regarding data management plans.  **Read them** and jot down any specific
  demands.
   > > Keep in mind: In NSF, most directorates and some divisions have unique,
    specific or narrower guidelines to follow than the general NSF
    specifications.

2. Outline your draft with the required sections from the guidelines.  These
 may be spelled out, or these may be presented as a set of questions that you
  must address.  Just create sub-headings that address each question.

3. Create a simple outline for yourself of the stages of your research project
 and the material generated at each stage. What is meant by material? The
  outputs – the files, papers, documents, data, notebooks, copies of things.  The
   stuff you generate, especially by writing, coding, or processing.

4. Create a list of the outputs you outlined above. Next to them, write down
 the file formats, expected size, and any unusual or special circumstances
  associated with them, e.g. privacy or confidentiality steps involved.

5. Write answers to the questions from item 2 above using the information
 you’ve gathered in items 3 and 4. Everything should be pretty straightforward.

### Tips

* Data management plans should be clear, logical, and easy to follow. Avoid
 unnecessary jargon. A reader should be able to follow your project’s stages by
  reading your plan. Don’t bother explaining scientific points, only explain
   data management points. Think ‘what’ and ‘where’, and not ‘why’.

* It should have some unique information not in the rest of the proposal. You
 probably don’t mention publishing the dataset, depositing it into a repository,
  or your choices of metadata schema anywhere else in your proposal. You may not
  mention specifics about data formatting, back-up procedures, or naming
   conventions (if relevant). Here’s the place to do it.

* This is not rocket science, so don’t overthink it. On the other hand, don’t
 treat this as an unfunded mandate or administrative burden either.  Cynicism or
  hand-wavy dismissal is easy for a reader to spot. Look, you know how to do
   your research, just write down what you do with the data.

* If you don’t know, ask. Some of this might be unfamiliar – what’s a metadata
 schema? What are my repository options?  If so, just ask at the Data Hub. If
  they aren’t the right people to help, they know the people on campus who can.
