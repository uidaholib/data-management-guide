# Why Manage Your Data?

- **Meet grant requirements:** Many funding agencies now require that researchers deposit any data which they collect as part of a research project in a repository or archive.
- **Increase the visibility and impact of your research:** Making your data available to other researchers through widely-searched repositories may increase your prominence and demonstrate continued use of the data and relevance of your research
- **Preserve your data:** Depositing your data in a repository guarantees their availability to you and other researchers. Doing so safeguards your investments of time and resources and preserves your unique contribution to research.
- **Facilitate new discoveries:** Enabling other researchers to use your data reinforces open scientific inquiry and may lead to new and unanticipated discoveries. Doing so also prevents duplication of effort by enabling others to use your data rather than trying to gather the data themselves.
- **Increase your research efficiency:** Documenting your data throughout their life cycles increases efficiency by ensuring you and others will be able to understand and use your data in the future. It will also ensure the integrity and proper description of your data are maintained.
- **Simplify your life:** Enabling a repository to house and disseminate your data allows you to focus on your research rather than responding to requests or worrying about data that may be housed on your web site.
- **Support open access:** Researchers are becoming increasingly aware of the need to manage their work and consider issues of scholarly communication.
