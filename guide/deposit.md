# Depositing Your Data in a Repository

Repositories are the backbone of data sharing. The best solution to sharing is
 to put data in an archival system that aims for long-term preservation, robust
  description and access methods, and will treat the data as essentially
   immutable.

There are many reasons to share your data with the world at large. Not least
 among these reasons is that several publishers and national funding agencies
  require you to do so. Sharing your data also, and more altruistically, allows
   your data to be used to answer other questions, both now and in the future.
    Most importantly, sharing data makes your papers more likely to be cited by
     other scientists:
      [One study](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0000308) found a 69%
       increase in citations for articles whose associated data were available
        online.

## Repositories at the University of Idaho

* **[University of Idaho Research Computing and Data Services (RCDS) Data Portal](https://data.nkn.uidaho.edu//)**
  * UI RCDS hosts a data repository for University of Idaho-produced data. It can
 accommodate most types of data and is free to U of I personnel. The repository
  is FAIR-compliant and backed up routinely with the Idaho National Laboratory.

* **[INSIDE Idaho - Geospatial Data](https://www.insideidaho.org)**
  * INSIDE Idaho is the official geospatial data clearinghouse for the State of
 Idaho. INSIDE Idaho serves as a comprehensive geospatial data digital library, providing access to, and a context within which to use, geospatial data and information by, for, and about Idaho.
