# The FAIR Data Principles

Data management and sharing may be conducted in many ways. Researchers often try
 to hold on to older methods, which typically default to no data sharing or to a
  system in which they are willing to share if asked by data seekers. There may
   be good reasons for restricting data like this, but often it is due to time
    and effort constraints. The FAIR data principles were established to set
     minimum expectations for how data is shared, to eliminate the biggest
      obstacles to re-using data.  Increasingly, DMPs are expected to conform to
       these principles.

Deliberately, the FAIR principles do not demand a specific technology for
 implementation. Instead, they can be fitted to a range of data management and
  publication choices.

**To be (F)indable:**

- F1. (meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier
- F2. data are described with rich metadata (defined by R1 below)
- F3. metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data it
 describes
- F4. (meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource

**To be (A)ccessible:**

- A1. (meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardized
 communications protocol
- A1.1 the protocol is open, free, and universally implementable
- A1.2 the protocol allows for an authentication and authorization procedure,
 where necessary
- A2. metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available

**To be (I)nteroperable:**

- I1. (meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable
 language for knowledge representation.
- I2. (meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles
- I3. (meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data

**To be (R)eusable:**

- R1. meta(data) are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes
- R1.1. (meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license
- R1.2. (meta)data are associated with detailed provenance
- R1.3. (meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards
