# Depositing Your Data in a Repository (Long Term Archiving)

There are many reasons to share your data with the world at large. 
Not least among these reasons is that several publishers and national funding agencies require you to do so. 
Sharing your data also, and more altruistically, allows your data to be used to answer other questions, both now and in the future. 
Most importantly, sharing data makes your papers more likely to be cited by other scientists: [One study](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0000308) found a 69% increase in citations for articles whose associated data were available online.
