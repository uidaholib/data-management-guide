# Storing and Backing Up Your Data

In order to to properly safeguard your data files, you should both **STORE**
 your data in a secure location that you can readily access and **BACKUP** your
  data in a separate physical location from those files in storage.

Here is what we mean by Storage and Backup:

* **Storage** refers to preserving your data files in a secure location you can
 access readily.
* **Backup** refers to preserving additional copies of your data in a separate
 physical location from data files in storage.

Storage systems often provide mirroring, in which data is written simultaneously
 to two drives. This is not the same thing as backup since alterations in the
  primary files will be mirrored in the second copy.

Backup preserves older copies so you can restore your data if accidental
 deletion/alteration or a disaster such as fire, flood, or hardware malfunction
  damages your data in storage.

When it comes to safeguarding your important data assets, remember both storage
 and backup are essential!

## Storing Your Data

Your data should be stored somewhere that is accessible and secure at the very
 least. For University of Idaho students and researchers, using a service like
  OneDrive will help you store and maintain the integrity of your data files
   across different computers and locations.

Many of these services provide mirroring services that will link a folder on
 your computer's hard drive with a folder stored on an online server. This means
  that when you save or make changes to files stored on your hard drive, those
   files are added or revised to in their online storage locations as well.

## Backing up Your Data

Following a good storage routine is one way to ensure your data is backed-up to
 some extent. However, to mitigate any losses of data, one should backup their
  data on a regular basis to another server or external hard drive that resides
   in a different physical location than your stored data.

A simple way to do this is to backup your data on a regular basis to an external
 hard drive that you store at your home rather than at your office. You can also
  upload your data to another cloud storage service (such as those mentioned
   above) on an ongoing basis.

**Caution:** Having too many backups can be as detrimental to the authenticity
 and preservation of your files as having none at all. Once you establish a
  protocol, follow it, and when you backup your data, make sure you do not
   create multiple copies of the same files or versions of files in different
    locations.

## Storing and Backing Up Your Lab's Data

Labs present a special problem for the storage and backup of data, as the large
 amount of data and the varying number of people who have access to that data
  can threaten the preservation of that data.

Establishing protocols for both the storage and backup of that data can help
 avoid problems in this regard.

Particularly, using a mirroring service, like those mentioned above, or a shared
 server, can help members of the lab to avoid losing any data.
