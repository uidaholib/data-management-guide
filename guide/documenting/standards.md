# Commonly Used Metadata Standards

In the case of datasets, metadata provides information regarding the who, what, when, where, how, etc. of a a dataset. 
This information will likely need to be recorded in a certain format in order to meet a recognizable standard. 
Check with a [librarian]({{ '/about/liaisons.html' | relative_url }}) or the depository into which you plan to deposit your data before you establish a plan for your metadata, to be sure you are following the correct guidelines.

Here is some information on common metadata standards, as well as some examples:

According to Executive Order 12096, all Federal agencies are ordered to use this standard to document geospatial data created as of January 1995. The standard is often referred to as the 'FGDC Metadata Standard' and has been implemented beyond the federal level with State and local governments adopting the metadata standard as well. See
