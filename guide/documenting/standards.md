# Commonly Used Metadata Standards

In the case of datasets, metadata provides information regarding the who, what,
 when, where, how, etc. of a a dataset. This information will likely need to be
  recorded in a certain format in order to meet a recognizable standard. Check
   with a [librarian]({{ '/about/liaisons.html' | relative_url }}) or the
    depository into which you plan to deposit your data before you establish a
     plan for your metadata, to be sure you are following the correct
      guidelines.

Here is some information on common metadata standards, as well as some examples:

## General

- **[Dublin Core (DC)](https://www.dublincore.org/)**: Widely used in disciplinary and institutional repositories

## Life Sciences

- **[Darwin Core](https://dwc.tdwg.org/)**: Designed to facilitate the sharing of information about
 biological diversity. It is primarily based on taxa, their occurrence in nature as documented by observations, specimens, and samples and related information. Primarily used in describing ecological specimens and for natural history collections.
- **[Ecological Metadata Language (EML)](https://eml.ecoinformatics.org/)**: Consists of XML modules that can be used  to document ecological datasets. A good standard for non-spatial environmental data

## Humanities

- **[Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)](https://tei-c.org/)**: A widely-used standard for representing
 textual materials in XML.

## Social Sciences

- **[Data Documentation Initiative (DDI)](http://www.ddialliance.org/)**: A metadata
 specification for the social and behavioral sciences created by the Data
  Documentation Initiative. Used to document data through its lifecycle and to
   enhance dataset interoperability.

## Geospatial

- **[Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata (CSDGM)](http://www.fgdc.gov/metadata/geospatial-metadata-standards)**:  CSDGM, Vers. 2 (FGDC-STD-001-1998) is the
 current US Federal Metadata standard. The Federal Geographic Data Committee
  (FGDC) originally adopted the CSDGM in 1994 and revised it in 1998. According
   to Executive Order 12096, all Federal agencies are ordered to use this
    standard to document geospatial data created as of January 1995. The
     standard is often referred to as the 'FGDC Metadata Standard' and has been
      implemented beyond the federal level with State and local governments
       adopting the metadata standard as well. See
        [this PDF document](http://www.fgdc.gov/metadata/documents/preparing-for-international-metadata-guidance.pdf)
         for guidance on moving from CSDGM to ISO.
- **[ISO 19115-2:2019](https://committee.iso.org/sites/tc211/home/projects/projects---complete-list/iso-19115-2.html)**: Geographic information - Metadata - Part 2: Extensions for
 imagery and gridded data. This is an international standard for describing
  geographic information and services. Part 2 added content for ISO 19115 that
   supports the documentation of imagery, gridded data and other remotely sensed
    data such as monitoring stations.

## Physical Sciences

- **[NetCDF Climate and Forecast (CF) Metadata Conventions](https://cfconventions.org/)**: The NetCDF Climate and Forecast (CF) Metadata
 Conventions are designed to promote the interoperable processing and sharing of
  data from netCDF files. They are focused on data use while the NetCDF
   Attribute Conventions are focused on data discovery.
- **WaterML**: [Water Markup Language](http://his.cuahsi.org/wofws.html#waterml) is
 an XML-based information exchange schema used in water data services by the
  Hydrological Information System (HIS). Produced by the Consortium of
   Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science (CUAHSI), this schema
    helps enable the discovery and analysis of water-related data.
