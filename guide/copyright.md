# Copyright & Intellectual Property

Copyright as it applies to data can be very complex. The information on this
 page is provided for informational purposes only, and should not be relied upon
  as definitive. If you are at all uncertain as to your specific rights,
   researchers are advised to seek counsel.

## General Copyright Guidelines

- Data cannot be copyrighted, but a particular expression of data (e.g. graph,
 chart) can be. These expressions generally fall under the same guidelines as
  [copyright protection for literature]({{ '/copyright/' | relative_url }}).
  - Although the expression may be copyrighted, the underlying data is still
   not protected.
- As with any copyright, copyright for data varies from country to country.
- A [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/) license can be attached to
 your data to explicitly promote sharing and unlimited use.

## Data from other sources

- **Original Data**
  - Be aware of any restrictions or licensing issues with any *third-party*
   original data that you are using.
  - If there is any question about your ability to use or reproduce data,
   contact the owner and/or publisher of the data.

- **Databases**
  - As [defined](http://www.copyright.gov/docs/regstat092303.html) by the US
   Copyright Office, a "database" is compilation - "a work formed by the
    collection and assembling of preexisting materials or of data."
     [17 U.S.C. 101](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/101)
  - A database can be copyrighted if the compilation is sufficiently original.
   For example, the US Supreme Court decided in Feist Publications v. Rural
    Telephone Service Co.(1991) that the information contained in telephone
     directory white pages is not copyrightable due to the lack of originality
      in the compilation, selection or arrangement. However, in a decision by
       the US Second Circuit appeals court in Key Publications, Inc. v.
        Chinatown Today Publishing Enterprises Inc. (1991), yellow pages
         listings do show sufficient originality to be copyrighted.
