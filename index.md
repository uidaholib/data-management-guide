# CollectionBuilder Docs

Everything you ever wanted to know about how to use CollectionBuilder-GH, CollectionBuilder-CONTENTdm, and CollectionBuilder-SA!

## Introduction

CollectionBuilder was designed with learning in mind--creating a CollectionBuilder project is a scaffolded process building web and data literacy skills with the outcome of generating awesome digital collections!
Learning something new is never easy, but we've tried our best to make the documentation and CollectionBuilder templates comprehensible to novice users.

Some initial setup is required to develop on your personal computer. 
However, once your environment is complete, you will be able to agilely generate CollectionBuilder digital collections, exhibits, and scholarship projects--or any type of static web site!

## Types

This Documentation applies to all the current "Types" of the CollectionBuilder tool. 
For the majority of the tool's features and setups, the documentation is the same. 
There are steps where the documentation does vary between types, however, so be on the lookout for bolded font and colored alerts that indicate when the documentation diverges. 

The types are currently: 

- **GH** - for [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-gh), a lightweight learning-focused template designed for free hosting on GitHub Pages.
- **CDM** - for [CollectionBuilder-CONTENTdm](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-contentdm), a template for generating a "skin" over an existing CONTENTdm repository.
- **SA** - for [CollectionBuilder-StandAlone](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-sa), a robust, stand-alone template for developing exhibits on your local computer (and serving them from anywhere!).
