## Data Management Guide

The University of Idaho Library strives to help researchers at the University of
 Idaho become familiar with data management practices. Librarians endeavor to
  communicate information about data storage standards and protocols, metadata
   reporting requirements and best practices, and the requirements and
    recommendations of national funding bodies and/or professional associations.
